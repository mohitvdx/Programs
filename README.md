## Competitive Programming Journey 

Welcome to my competitive programming repository! This repo tracks my learning and problem-solving on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/mohitvdx) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/mohitvdx/).

## Goals

- **Strengthen problem-solving skills** through regular practice.
- **Master data structures and algorithms** essential for contests and interviews.
- **Track my progress** in speed, accuracy, and depth across topics.

## Platforms

- **Codeforces:** Regular contests for real-time problem-solving.
- **LeetCode:** In-depth focus on patterns and popular interview problems.
